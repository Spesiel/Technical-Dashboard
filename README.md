# Technical Dashboard

Last release: 0.0.1
Last version: 0.0.1

## A few notes
This skin relies on system informations, and MSI Afterburner for the rest.

There will be shortcuts and utilities later to help with this.

When hovering a widget, a gear icon might appear at the top right of it. This indicates that the widget can be configured. You can access those configuration options by clicking on it.

The widgets which feature that options are followed by a # sign in the list below. Those which relies on HWiNFO are also followed by a *.

On its first launch, some files will be created. You may have to refresh the widget if it doesn't appear to be working.

This skin features some PICOL icons.

## A short list of what's available..

- 4 clocks featuring the date #
- a way to monitor the uptime
### System monitoring

## The not so obvious..
- double-click a widget to access a menu featuring a way to configure the widget (if available), access to scaling system, access to themes
- when mousing over a widget having a configuration tool, a gear will show up in the upper-right corner of it

## Bugs? Yeah, most probably
I try to iron out each widget until it works as I intend it, but something might have slipped my mind once I got it working.. The perks of working in the middle of the night..
Please feel free to send a message, post an issue, something. I'll get it sorted shortly.
